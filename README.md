Project Overview: <br>
Team 9 will be developing a website where you can track your progress on all the TV shows and movies you watch. You will be able to add new titles to your collection,
add a rating and a review for each, and mark media as "watch now," "watch later," "on hold," etc. You will be able to keep track of which season and episode of a TV show you are on, as well as mark separate pieces of media as a part of the same franchise for clarity. Finally, the website will also provide minor data about what you add to your collection, such as your average rating for all pieces of media.
