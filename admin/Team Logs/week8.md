# Week8 Guidence Document

This is a guidence document of what we need to implement and test for week8, written by Ray. To reduce the complexity, the comments and thoughts are put at the end of this document.

The structure of this document is not perfectly organized and I apologize for that. lease take a look at this guide and leave your comments/questions at the end of the document or slack.

Lastly, this guidence is not complete and may contains conflicts.

## Data Storage
All functions should be written in `tools.js`.

All the movie information are stored as value of key `shows` in localstorage. The following functions are required for data operations:
### Getter: `getShowsFromStorage()`
- Input: None;
- Output: The array contains all movie information that are stored as value of key `shows` in localstorage;
- Modification: None;
### Setter: `saveShowsToStorage()`
- Input: An array contains all movie information that want to be stored as value of key `shows` in localstorage;
- Output: None;
- Modification: update the localstorage.
### Structure of `show`
We define the element in the the array contains all movie information that are stored as value of key `shows` in localstorage as `show`. Each show should have following key-value pairs:
- "title": `String`; This should be **unique**.
- "imgSrc": `String`
- "imgAlt": `String`
- "movie": `boolean`; `True` means this is a movie.
- "movieDuration": `Integer`; `1` means movie is 1 minute long. 
- "movieHasWatched": `Integer`; `1` means the movie has already been watched for the first 1 minute. 
- "showNumEpisodes": `Integer`; `1` means the show has total of 1 episode.
- "showEpisodesWatched": `Array of Integer`: `[1,10]` means the episodes 1 and 10 has been watched.
- "rating": `Integer`; 
- "comments": `String`

We assume all the attributes are valid for each `show`. Validation check should be formed before adding new `show`. 

## Main Page: `index.html`
Files that are modified: `main.js`, `index.html`, 

Optional: `form.html`, `form.js`, `detail.html`, `detail.js`

### Navigate Bar
- Design and implement the navigate bar with following links:
  - Watch List: A linkage to watch list page.
### Add button
- Design and implement the add button for adding the show. Folling concerns should be considered before implementing:
  - Since we want to use "form" to make the user add data to our application, should we create another page called `form.html` that specifically built for this purpose or should we hide such form in `index.html` and appears only needed? What's the operation we need to perform after user submitted the form?
### Form: Add new `show` to our application. 
- Create a form that could matched the above attributes.
  - Think about how to seperate movie from show. 
The form should have one function connected to it, called `updateShows()`:
- Input: user inputs in the form
- Output: None
- Modification: updating the local storage by calling `getShowsFromStorage()` and `saveShowsToStorage()`.

Note: Data verification need to be performed in this function to ensure all attributes are valid.
### Display section
- Design and implement the display section for showwing small cards.(Mostly CSS since there would be no concrete HTML code. All the HTML elements in the wrapper are generated by the following functions.)

The javascipt code should looks like somthing as following:
```
window.addEventListener('TODO', init);

function init() {
  TODO
}
```
Note: If we want to integrate the form we mentioned above into `index.html`, then a `formhandler()` function should also be included somewhere in the js code.

In this initialization function, we should get the data from local storage and then using such data to create small cards. The operation is suggested to be wrapped as following function, `addSmallCards()`
- Input: `shows` from local storage(If we get `shows` outside of the function, otherwise, it should be none)
- Output: None
- Modifications: add bunch of small cards into out `index.html`.

Note: There are various ways to implement the above function. But the easiest way to do so is to create a new class of `HTMLElement` called `smallCard`. The implementation could refer to lab6 and lab7 and define an element called `smallCard` from this class. Then we could simply create bunch of `smallcard`s in `addSmallCards()`. 

### Showing Expanded Card
Similarly, we are going to implement a function called `addExpandedCard()`. However, the detail is not discussed well and there are two possible ways for implementation.

#### Method 1: New page.
We need a new page called `detail.html`.

Step1. Design and implement all the html and css code outside the wrapper. The wrapper is where we would insert the expanded card.

Step2. Modify the innerHTML of `smallCard`.(For example, make the some DOM as a link to the `detail.html`). And when the user click the small card, add an indicator in local storage so we know which show the user want to see in detail. 

Step3. Like what we did for `smallCards`, we insert a desired expanded card into the wrapper in `detail.html`.

#### Method 2: Stay in the same page.
Instead of creating a new page, we could also simply insert the expanded card write below the small cards.

## Comments
### Change of the key used in localstorage(Ray)
The current key used in localstorage is called `cards`. I changed it to `shows` as the data in localstorage are actually some attributes the show and has nothing to do with the cards so `shows` would be more self-explained.

### Combining `showCard` and `movieCard`(Ray)
The current implementation of either small cards or expanded cards seperate `movieCard` from `showCard`. Such design has increased the complexity of the system and has no obvious benefit. Therefore, integrate `movieCard` into `showCard` seems like a great idea. Such change could making the initialization of cards simpler. 

### Modification of key-pair used in `show`(Ray)
Changed few names of keys in `show` so the name is more self-explained. Also changed some data structure of values. The changes include:
- add of `movie`. So we know whether this `show` is a movie or not. 
- `numEpisodes` to `showNumEpisodes`: adding `show` in front of the name to seprate it from movie.
- `episodesWatched` to `showEpisodesWatched`: adding `show` in front of the name to seprate it from movie; Changing the value from `Integer` to `Array`.

## Thinking
### We need to get `shows` from local storage everytime, better ways?(Ray)
In the above implementation, `shows` only exist inside of the function scope and each time we need to call `getShowsFromStorage()`. Seems not effecient enough. Might be helpful to think about a better way so we could repeatly use the same data. 

### Optimazation(Ray)
There are a lot of parts in our code that could be optimized. But we need to finish the implementation first and then improve the code.
