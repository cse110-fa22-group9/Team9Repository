## Meeting Notes:
Pranav Brought up what was talked about in Lead Meeting with himself and Malcom
- Main takeaway is that unit tests to determine data flow are essential and though they may be redundant, need to be included with E2E testing
- Unit testing is possible with mock local storage
- We will also need to use JS Docs

Code will be finalized Sunday Night, all tickets due Sunday at Noon

Tickets are mainly documentation and testing based, a few CSS and Javascript, but very little to do site wise for the last sprint
Mainly just making sure the pieces are in place to be accurately graded and reflective of group discussions

## Meeting Decision
Tickets assigned
- Unit Testing for all JS files
- Favicon implementation
- High Level Documentation
- Merging into CI-Pipeline and testing github pages
- CSS for add content and new slider feature
- Implementing character cap on review

#### Meeting End Time:
9:40 PM PST
