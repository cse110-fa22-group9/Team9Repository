# Proposals

## Housing CRUD Application
- People don't like renting out to students 
- Make a housing app made only for students
- Bookmark houses, add and delete interested listings
- Renter side as well to create listings for houses
- Concerns over making the app local-first
  - Notes app for housing search instead 

## Journal App
- similar to mood journal idea from previous meeting
- Able to add plans
- Connection to mindfulness apps
  - mindfulness, meditation
- Keep track of mental health
- Still concerns over local-first but seems more feasible

## Game library
- View games you bought but haven't played, games you have played, etc.
- Ratings and reviews
- The movie/TV show collection idea but for games
