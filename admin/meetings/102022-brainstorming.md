# Meeting Agenda:

1) First, we discussed any and all new project proposals that came into anyone's head in between meetings.
2) Narrowing all these project ideas down to two, we brainstormed on them both and created a Miro board for which to diagram our brainstorming. We adjourned the meeting after that.

The new project ideas proposed during this meeting, as well as their details, are written below: 

### Housing CRUD Application
- People don't like renting out to students 
- Make a housing app made only for students
- Bookmark houses, add and delete interested listings
- Renter side as well to create listings for houses
- Concerns over making the app local-first
  - Notes app for housing search instead 

### Journal App
- similar to mood journal idea from previous meeting
- Able to add plans
- Connection to mindfulness apps
  - mindfulness, meditation
- Keep track of mental health
- Still concerns over local-first but seems more feasible
- Face rating system, graph feelings over time
- Search system (search by faces, search by notes)

### Game library
- View games you bought but haven't played, games you have played, etc.
- Ratings and reviews
- The movie/TV show collection idea but for games

# Meeting Decisions
- Our project ideas were narrowed down to two. The two ideas we picked were the show/movie tracking application (which we dubbed BingeTracker) and the journal app that was proposed during this meeting. The Miro board was used to diagram our ideas and thought processes on those two project proposals.

#### Meeting End Time:
10:00 PM PST
