## Meeting Agenda:
* First, attendants went over the meeting minute assignments, to decide the order of which the person doing the meeting minutes would be assigned and rotated. This took around ten minutes of the meeting duration.
* Next, we went over the group contract, discussing our group values as well as how to hold each other accountable when those values are violated in some form
* After that, we broke up the work for the team site, discussing how the site building would be handled as well as who in particular would handle it. We took a group photo for the team page and noted down each of our individual quotes.
* Finally, we recorded all of the footage for our team video, a humorous take on introducing ourselves in a style resembling that of the show The Office.
* With all that done, we adjourned the meeting.

* Aedan proposed the idea of making our team video in the style of The Office to introduce ourselves in a humorous way, which we all agreed to move forth with unanimously. The resulting footage came out very nicely.
* Cindy was nominated to design the logo for Team 9, due to her experience in drawing. Chenfei stepped up to compile all the acquited information into the team page.
* Communication became one of the major themes that our group really came to emphasize in our group contract. We all shared similar experiences of being ghosted on group assignments, and we wanted to make sure situations like that, as well as other situations pertaining to miscommunication or lack of proper communication, were proprerly noted down in the contract so that everyone would be held accountable.
