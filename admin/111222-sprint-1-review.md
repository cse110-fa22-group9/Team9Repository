## Meeting Notes:
From Pranav:
HTML skeletons have been created for watchlist page and subpage
Form Stucture has been created, might need documentation updates
HTML for the sidebar included in wireframe done
CSS has not been done yet, to be implemented in week 8

Sickness is affecting quite a few team members, Anish, Jackie, and Cindy primarily as of now

From Jackie and Ruihan:
Beginning files for JS have been created, basic skeleton is there
Design and lead team meet was buried so JS team was a little confused on data
Small movie card and Expanded movie card data fill has been implemented, Shadow DOM created
Local storage implementation created

Lot's of differing repos as of now for JS, should be refactored

JS team was unable to test because HTML is currently not in place, but frameworks are done

Ruihan is currenlty feeling like there was a lot of seperation among JS team, meeting required to refactor code into one consistent branch

Ray specifically was confused about innerHTML and how that should be implemented

Ann brought up Dummy code being used for smallMoviecard

Pranav and Chenfei have worked on CI/CD pipeline
- Checks HTML validitiy, currently local to main
- Linting HTML style, also on main
- Codacy has been implemented, link on slack in annoucements

Pranav brought up that team split was also driven by CI/CD pipeline development

Moving to retrospective to establish concerns

#### Meeting End Time:
8:56 PM
