### Add New JS Files to Organize JS Code Better

Added a tools.js, as well as JS files for each type of card, so that the code would go in their respective spots and it
wouldn't be all smooshed into one main.js file.

main.js file is now used only for the init function as well as the function of adding movie and show cards to the watch list
page when the page renders. If anything important besides these are added to main.js, a separate ADR will record that
decision.
