## ADR: Documentation Structure

We have decided to have one large Documentation document with links to sections within the document that will hold all the high level overviews for each
file / family of files (including tests). This will be in addition to JSDocs generated from each file which will have a deeper dive into the aspects of each file. 

We found that all the high level documentation in one file was easier to navigate instead of multiple files. In addition to deeper level docs this gives an
overall rounded approach.
