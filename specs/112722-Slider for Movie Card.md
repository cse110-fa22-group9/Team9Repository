ADR Slider Implementation:

We have decided to add a slider to the expandedMovieCard to make it feel more manually adjustable along the same lines as our expandedShowCard
which has actual clickable buttons. The slider will actively change how far along you are in the movie which will update to local storage, and reflect
on the progress bar for the smallMovieCard version.

The original Expanded Movie Card felt to empty and didn't have the same level as depth as the show Card, and we felt a slider best represented how to
update the time for the movie much like the checkboxes feel like the right way to update an individual episode. This slider will be customized to more fit
the asthetic of our site unlike the automatically generated HTML.
